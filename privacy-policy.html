                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This privacy policy is applicable to the Secure Lock Notes app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed by Oleksandr Kiptilyi (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>
                <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</strong> The Application does not maintain any server-side databases for storing user data. All user-generated content is always stored locally on your device.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The Service Provider is committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA) in the United States. This policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information. By using the Application, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Application.</p>

            <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
            <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. In this Application, this may include an email address or other contact details only if you voluntarily provide them for feedback or support inquiries.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Any operation performed on Personal Data, including collecting, storing, using, or disclosing.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Provider (or "We", "Us", "Our"):</strong> Oleksandr Kiptilyi, the developer of the Application.</li>
                <li><strong>You:</strong> The individual accessing or using the Application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>We collect information to provide, maintain, and improve the Application, based on our legitimate interests (e.g., app functionality and analytics), your consent (e.g., for optional features), or legal obligations.</p>

            <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
            <p>The Application acquires the information you supply when you download and use the Application. The Application does not require any user registration. However, some optional features (such as Google Drive backup) may require authentication through third-party services like Google OAuth. The only possible communication with users is through voluntary email submissions for feedback or support inquiries. We collect email addresses or other contact details only if you voluntarily provide them via feedback forms or support inquiries. The Service Provider may contact users only in response to feedback requests or support inquiries submitted through the Application.</p>

            <h3>Support and Feedback Information</h3>
            <p>When you contact us for support or send feedback through the Application, the message may include additional technical diagnostic information (such as app version, device model, operating system version, or similar technical details).</p>
            <p><strong>This information does not include your personal content</strong> (such as notes, passwords, or files) and is used solely to help us diagnose problems and improve the Application.</p>

            <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <p>Certain technical information may be collected automatically by third-party services integrated into the Application (such as Google Play Services or AdMob). This may include device type, unique device ID, IP address, operating system version, mobile browser type, and information about how you use the Application (e.g., usage patterns, crash reports). The Application itself does not directly collect this information.</p>
            <p>We rely on our legitimate interest in improving the Application and providing services as a lawful basis for this processing.</p>

            <h2>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>
            <p>The Application does not directly collect or access your device's precise location data. However, third-party advertising services integrated into the Application may use your IP address to determine your approximate geographical location for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advertising Services:</strong> Third-party advertising networks may use IP-based location data to provide location-relevant advertisements.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized location data may be used by third-party services to analyze user behavior and improve ad targeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Optimization:</strong> External advertising services may use approximate location data to optimize their offerings and improve user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Application itself does not request location permissions and does not access your device's GPS or other location services directly.</strong></p>

            <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
            <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

            <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>
                <li>when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>
                <li>with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Data may be transferred to the United States or other countries outside the EEA; these transfers are protected by adequate safeguards, such as the EU-US Data Privacy Framework for Google services.</p>

            <h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>
            <p>You can halt all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

            <p>For personalized ads via AdMob, you can opt-out via your device settings (Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization) or visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adssettings.google.com</a> to manage preferences.</p>

            <p>Under GDPR and CCPA, you have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data;</li>
                <li>Object to processing based on legitimate interests;</li>
                <li>Data portability (receive your data in a structured format);</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent at any time (without affecting prior processing).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:dotcodeapp@gmail.com">dotcodeapp@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within 30 days (or 45 days under CCPA, if extended).</p>

            <h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. The Service Provider will retain Automatically Collected information for up to 24 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate. If you'd like the Service Provider to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at <a href="mailto:dotcodeapp@gmail.com">dotcodeapp@gmail.com</a> and we will respond in a reasonable time. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for the Application to function properly.</p>

            <div class="important-note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Most user data (including notes, passwords, audio files, photos, and attachments) is always stored locally on your device and can be permanently deleted by the user at any time using the secure deletion feature within the Application.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>This Application is intended for users aged 18 and older as specified in our target audience settings. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If we discover such data, we will delete it immediately. If you are a parent or guardian concerned about your child's use of this Application, we recommend monitoring their device usage and utilizing built-in parental controls.</p>

            <p>The Application operates primarily with local data storage on the user's device. We do not maintain servers that store users' personal information or notes. The limited information we may receive includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous feedback messages (when users voluntarily send feedback)</li>
                <li>Technical device information for app improvement purposes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do not collect age information from users, nor do we have mechanisms to verify user age.</p>

            <p>Third-party services integrated into the Application (such as AdMob for advertising) have their own data collection practices and age-related policies. These services are responsible for their own compliance with laws regarding minors.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. No employees or contractors of the Service Provider have access to your personal notes, passwords, or attachments, since the Application does not maintain any server-side databases. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>

            <h3>Data Encryption and Local Storage</h3>
            <p>The Application employs strong encryption methods to protect user data stored locally on the device. All user-generated data, including notes, passwords, audio files, and photos, is always stored locally on your device and encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption algorithms before being stored. The Application does not have any server-side databases, ensuring that your data remains under your control and is not accessible to the Service Provider or third parties unless explicitly shared by you.</p>

            <p>When using the optional Google Drive backup feature, your data is encrypted locally on your device before being transmitted and stored in your personal Google Drive account. This feature is entirely optional and requires your explicit consent. The Service Provider does not have access to, cannot decrypt, and cannot view your backed-up data.</p>

            <h3>Biometric Data</h3>
            <p>The Application may use biometric authentication (such as fingerprint or face recognition) for app access security. This biometric information is processed entirely on your device using your device's secure biometric systems and is never transmitted to or stored on external servers.</p>
